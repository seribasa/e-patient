## 1. Executive Summary

e-Patient adalah aplikasi patient-facing untuk membantu pasien dan keluarga mengelola perjalanan kesehatan secara aman: membuat profil pasien, mengatur anggota keluarga/caregiver, mencari layanan kesehatan, melakukan booking, membayar, menerima reminder, melihat timeline kesehatan dasar, dan mengelola consent/privacy.

PRD ini mengerucutkan BRD menjadi requirement produk yang siap dipakai untuk validasi UX, penyusunan backlog, dan perencanaan engineering. Fokus awal adalah **MVP: Foundation and Care Access**, bukan seluruh visi longitudinal health platform.

### 1.1 Product Thesis

e-Patient menjadi pendamping kesehatan keluarga yang membuat administrasi kesehatan lebih rapi tanpa mengorbankan privasi pasien.

### 1.2 MVP Promise

Pengguna dapat:

- Membuat akun dan profil pasien sendiri.
- Menambahkan dependent yang sah dikelola.
- Mengundang anggota dewasa/caregiver dengan akses terbatas dan dapat dicabut.
- Mencari fasyankes/provider/layanan.
- Booking layanan untuk diri sendiri atau anggota yang berhak dikelola.
- Melihat status booking, payment, reminder, dan QR/check-in.
- Melihat timeline aktivitas/dokumen dasar dengan label sumber.
- Mengelola consent, akses keluarga, audit aktivitas, dan support issue.

### 1.3 Critical Product Principle

**Household is not consent.** Satu rumah tangga/care circle hanya mengorganisasi orang, bukan otomatis membuka akses data medis. Akses harus eksplisit, granular, dapat dicabut, dan diaudit.

---

## 2. Goals and Non-Goals

### 2.1 Product Goals

| ID | Goal | Success Signal |
|---|---|---|
| G-01 | Pasien dapat menyelesaikan booking layanan kesehatan secara end-to-end | Search-to-booking conversion, booking confirmed rate |
| G-02 | Keluarga dapat membantu pasien tanpa akses berlebihan | Grant accepted rate, revoke success, low access dispute |
| G-03 | Payment dan appointment memiliki status jelas | Payment completion, payment mismatch rate |
| G-04 | Dokumen/aktivitas kesehatan dasar lebih mudah ditemukan | Timeline usage, document upload, record detail view |
| G-05 | Produk dipercaya karena consent dan audit transparan | Privacy center usage, audit visibility, low unauthorized access report |
| G-06 | Fasyankes/operator dapat menjalankan supply side minimum | Slot accuracy, check-in completion, reconciliation success |

### 2.2 MVP Non-Goals

- Tidak memberi diagnosis, rekomendasi pengobatan, atau clinical decision support otomatis.
- Tidak menjadi RME penuh untuk fasyankes.
- Tidak menjanjikan layanan emergency.
- Tidak memberikan akses medis penuh hanya karena satu KK/household.
- Tidak mengelola klaim BPJS/asuransi end-to-end.
- Tidak menyediakan e-prescription/pharmacy fulfillment pada MVP.
- Tidak melakukan broad SATUSEHAT sync sebelum jalur legal, partner, dan teknis selesai.

## 5. Product Experience Overview

### 5.1 Navigation Model

Mobile app uses five primary destinations:

| Destination | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Home | Patient context, next appointment, quick actions, family profiles |
| Care | Provider/service search, provider detail, booking entry |
| Records | Timeline, documents, health items, upload/report |
| Calendar | Appointment, reminder, preventive schedule, medication reminders |
| Privacy | Consent, grants, audit, data rights, support/dispute |

### 5.2 Patient Context Model

Every sensitive workflow starts with a clear active patient context:

- Who is the patient?
- Who is acting?
- What permission does the actor have?
- Who is paying, if payment is required?

This prevents confusing “user account” with “patient profile”.

### 5.3 Design Reference

The Figma page `03 Material 3 UX Improved` contains the latest product design direction:

- 44 mobile screens.
- 8 provider/admin ops screens.
- Material 3-style navigation, surfaces, cards, chips, tonal buttons, and error states.
- UX architecture and review notes.

## 15. Open Decisions

### P0 Before Engineering

1. Who is the primary customer: patient, family, fasyankes, employer, or B2B2C mix?
2. What is the launch wedge: outpatient booking, chronic care, family organizer, or home care?
3. Is Seribasa only a platform operator or also a healthcare service operator?
4. Is health record a user-controlled vault, provider copy, or part of official RME?
5. Which pilot provider and region?
6. Is household based on official KK or flexible care circle? Recommendation: flexible care circle.
7. What is default family grant? Recommendation: appointment + payment only.
8. How is guardian/dependent proof verified?
9. Who is merchant of record?
10. Who owns refund/chargeback liability?

### P1 Before Final MVP Backlog

1. Is guest browsing allowed?
2. Can profile without NIK book certain services?
3. Is QR check-in mandatory or optional by provider?
4. Which document/record types are in MVP?
5. Which notification channels are transactional vs promotional?
6. Is Stripe relevant for Indonesia launch or should Midtrans-like local gateway be primary?
7. Is MVP Bahasa Indonesia only?
8. What are support SLAs for account takeover, access dispute, and wrong-patient data?
9. Is telemedicine/home care included or delayed?
10. Who owns SATUSEHAT integration path?
